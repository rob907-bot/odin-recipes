    <li>1 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rice wine</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon banana ketchup</li>

</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 4 cups of peanut oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and the cornstarch. Mix in the chicken until all the pieces are coated with batter. Drop into the hot oil a piece at a time; cook until the chicken is golden brown on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, about 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    <li>Stir together the vinegar, wine, sugar, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and the banana ketchup in a small bowl until smooth; set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the dried chile peppers and cook for a few seconds until the peppers brighten. Stir in the onion, garlic, and orange zest. Cook and stir until the onion is beginning to brown. Stir in the sauce; bring to a boil before adding the fried chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and stir until the chicken pieces are well coated with the sauce, a few minutes longer. Serve sprinkled with green onions and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
